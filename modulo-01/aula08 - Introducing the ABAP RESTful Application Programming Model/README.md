# Introducing the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model

The **ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP)** is a modern, opinionated framework by [SAP](https://help.sap.com/docs/ABAP_PLATFORM/66906ae3920c4fc684cf588290fb9267/6eafc043c18b4bdbbe7c2212c573549b.html?version=100) for developing scalable, cloud-ready Fiori applications and web APIs in the ABAP environment. It uses a unified architecture based on Core Data Services (CDS) and the ABAP language within the **ABAP Development Tools (ADT) in Eclipse**. 

## Core Principles and Architecture 

RAP simplifies development by providing a structured, three-layer architecture: 

1. **Data Modeling & Behavior:** This layer defines the structure of the business object (BO) using CDS view entities and specifies its behavior (create, read, update, delete, and custom actions) in a behavior definition.

2. **Business Services Provisioning:** A projection layer exposes a subset of the business object's fields and behavior for a specific use case (e.g., a Fiori UI or a Web API), with UI-specific annotations typically placed in metadata extensions.

3. **Service Consumption:** The exposed service is consumed by a client (e.g., an [SAP Fiori Elements app](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/development-in-abap-restful-application-programming-model-rap)) via the OData protocol (V2 or V4).

## Key Development Steps (Managed Scenario) 

The typical development flow for a new (greenfield) transactional application using the managed implementation type is: 

1. **Define Database Tables:** Create the transparent tables in the ABAP Dictionary to store the business data.

2. **Create CDS Root View Entity:** Define the semantic data model by creating a root CDS view entity on top of the database table(s). This is the basis of your business object.

3. **Define Behavior:** Create a behavior definition for the CDS view entity to specify standard operations (create, update, delete) and custom logic (actions, validations, determinations). For a _managed_ scenario, the standard CRUD operations are handled automatically by the RAP framework.

4. **Project the Business Object:** Create a CDS projection view to tailor the data model for the specific service consumption, often adding UI annotations in separate metadata extensions (``.asddlsql``) to control the Fiori app's look and feel.

5. **Define the Service:** Create a service definition to expose the projection views you want to make available.

6. **Bind the Service and Publish:** Create a service binding to define the communication protocol (OData V2/V4, UI, or Web API). Publishing the service generates a URL that can be used to preview the application directly within ADT.

## Essential Tools and Technologies 

- **ABAP Development Tools (ADT) in Eclipse:** The primary IDE for RAP development, providing wizards and integrated tools.

- **Core Data Services (CDS):** The language for defining the data models and their structure.

- **ABAP Language:** Used for implementing custom business logic, such as validations or actions, in a behavior implementation class (behavior pool).

- **SAP Fiori Elements:** The standard UI technology that consumes the OData services generated by RAP to provide a consistent and modern user experience with minimal UI coding.
